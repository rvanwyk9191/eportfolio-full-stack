                <p>I am a Java API focused developer with expertise in microservices, SaaS, and Event Driven architectures.
                    I joined JPMorgan Chase after college and spent nearly six years working on various projects relating to regulation, marketing, and evergreen.
                    After working on my last project with JPMorgan Chase, I decided to try living in Miami for six months to emerse myself in a different experience, but due to some external factors, I decided to move back to Chicago.
                    To continue the emersion process, I joined Fiserv as a Contractor through KForce. In July 2020, I was offered a full-time position, and I currently am employed by Fiserv.</p>
                <b>Early part of my life: </b><p>I was born in Evander, South Africa in 1991. My parents, wanting a better future for their family, decided to move to Chicago in 1999. I grew up in Aurora, Illinois and graduated from Oswego East High School, and later Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois with my Bachelors of Science in Computer Information Systems.</p>
                <b>What are my hobbies: </b><p>I've always been a fan of Electronic music since I was 7. I grew up being an outsider and listening to Trance music through middle and high school. In college, I bought myself DJ equipment and have stuck with DJing for the past seven years.</p>
                <p>I was also a Cross-Country and Track runner in High School and part of college, so I keep myself active currently. I am getting more into the science of our bodies and learning everyday about what foods and exercises work best for my body. Fitness and nutrition has become a passion of mine in the last few years.</p>
                <b>Where do I see myself in five years: </b>
                <p>Growing up, my mom always told me to build a skill and find my passion to apply the skill to. I'm in the never ending process of growing my IT skills, but I am at least finding my passion, which is to connect to people.
                    I would like to begin working on projects that reflect who I am as a person, where I can grow the most, and lend my passion to others in the same position. Once I get myself in the right project, I would like to move into management and focus on people development.</p>
